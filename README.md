# autograd
This neural network (NN) includes a `Neuron` class with weights, bias, and tanh activation. The `Layer` class groups neurons into a layer, and the `MLP` (Multi-Layer Perceptron) class stacks layers to form a fully connected feedforward network. It supports forward passes and visualizes the computational graph.
